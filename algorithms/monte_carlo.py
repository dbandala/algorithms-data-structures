# Montecarlo algorithm
# The Monte Carlo algorithm is a statistical technique that allows you to make numerical estimates using random sampling.
# It is often used in scenarios where it is difficult or impossible to compute an exact result.

# Example use cases include:
# 1. Estimating the value of Ï€ (pi) by randomly sampling points in a square and counting how many fall within a quarter circle.
# 2. Simulating complex systems, such as weather patterns or stock market fluctuations, to understand their behavior over time.
# 3. Solving optimization problems by exploring a large search space and identifying promising regions through random sampling.
