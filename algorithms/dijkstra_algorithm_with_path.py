# Dijkstra algorithm implementation
#
# Dijkstra's algorithm is an algorithm for finding the shortest paths between nodes in a graph, which may represent, for example, road networks.
# It was conceived by computer scientist Edsger W. Dijkstra in 1956 and published three years later.
# The algorithm exists in many variants; Dijkstra's original variant found the shortest path between two nodes, but a more common variant fixes a single node as the "source" node and finds shortest paths from the source to all other nodes in the graph, producing a shortest-path tree.

# The time complexity is O(V^2) where V is the number of vertices in the graph. If the graph is represented as an adjacency list, the time complexity is O(E + V log V) where E is the number of edges in the graph.
# The space complexity is O(V) where V is the number of vertices in the graph.
